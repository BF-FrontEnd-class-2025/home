## About me

I am 27 years old, although I still feel young 🫣

In 2020 I have lived in Portugal for half a year. We had to move because we
wanted more money. 🤑

And it's been already 2 years since I call Brussels _my home_.

Here I have worked in HoReCa for 1 and a half years and I broke myself. 😜

That is how I decided I want to change something asap and voilá I am here at the
HYF course.

### Social status

My best friend and I were together for 4 years when he finally decided I am
worth being his wife 😮‍💨 We have been married for 1 year and a half and last year
in August we have played our wedding. This was the best day in my life, so far.
